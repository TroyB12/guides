## Area of a Circle
---

The formula to finding the area of a circle is : **A = πr²**

###### Formula when knowing Radius

**A = πr²**

*Example*

What is the area of a circle with a radius of 3m?

- Area = πr²
    - r = 3
- π * 3²
- 3.14 * (3 * 3)
- **28.27m²**

The first formula deals with the **diamter**.

###### Formula when knowing Diameter

Diameter is made up of two radii (plural form of radius).

*Example*

What is the area of a circle with a diameter of 10m?

- Area = πr²
  - r = 10 / 2
  - r = 5
- π * 5²
- 3.14 * (5 * 5)
- **78.5**
